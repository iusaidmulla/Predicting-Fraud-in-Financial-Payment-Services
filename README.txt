# ~Predicting-Fraud-in-Financial-Payment-Services~

> Trying to recognize and predict fraud in financial transactions is a good example of binary classification analysis. 
> A transaction either is fraudulent, or it is genuine. 
> What makes fraud detection especially challenging is the is the highly imbalanced distribution between positive (genuine) and negative (fraud) classes.

> In the analysis I used a synthetic dataset of mobile money transactions. 
> It consists of nearly 6.4 million rows of data divided into five types of transactions; CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER. 
> Fraud occurs only in two of them; TRANSFER, CASH_OUT. The number of transactions in these types was almost 2.8 million, and the number of fraudulent transactions among them was only c. 8000, making it a truly skewed set of data!

> The optimal solution turned out to be a combination of feature-engineering and extreme gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost). 
> The predictive power of the model was 0.98, as measured by the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Crucially, these results were obtained without artificial balancing of the data, such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), making this approach suitable to real-world applications
